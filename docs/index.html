        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            A PC version of a short-lived trading card game based on the Sonic anime that originally aired between 2003 and 2006?
            It's more likely than you think!
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>What is the Sonic X TCG?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    The Sonic X Trading Card Game was a 2-player game created by Score Entertainment that debuted in 2005, and was
                    sold as 10-card booster packs costing $2.99 each, with a minimum of 3 packs per player needed to play the game.
                    There were 110 unique cards in total, with 5 having promotional variants with different art. 80 of the cards
                    are Commons, with the remaining 30 being Rares, and each booster pack contained 9 Commons and 1 Rare.
                </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Sounds fun! Where can I get some?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    If you're looking for brand-new cards, you're out of luck: despite the low entry cost (less than $9 per person)
                    and the ease of gaining a complete collection, the cards sold poorly, and production ceased by 2007. If you don't
                    mind buying used, there's listings on eBay and similar websites.
                </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>I looked, but all I could find was the Sonic X Card Game, which looks a lot like the TCG.</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    That's because it is! The Card Game box set contains 5 copies each of 22 cards, 15 of which are from the TCG, and
                    7 that would have been part of an expansion set of another 110 unique cards, also with 80 Commons and 30 Rares;
                    you can tell the extra 7 as they have a Shadow icon in the top-right corner of the card. The rules also have an
                    extension that allows up to four players to play, though extra cards will be required as the minimum player deck
                    is still 30 cards.
                </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>That makes 117 unique cards, correct? How many are in the PC game?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    Correct, and all 117.
                </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>What about the promo variants?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    As the promotional cards are functionally identical to their regular equivalents, there's no plans to include them
                    at this time, especially as there only appears to be information about four of the five promotional variants.
                </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>What about the number of players?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    The minimum is 2 players, and while in theory there's no maximum, for practical purposes the maximum is 8 players,
                    with each player having their own copy of the game.
                </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>How much will it cost?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    Absolutely nothing! Just use the 'Download' button at the top of the page.
                </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>But what if I want to donate anyway?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    Keep your money and spend it on official Sonic products direct from Sega and their licenced partners ðŸ˜‰
